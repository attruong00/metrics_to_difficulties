# metrics_to_difficulties
train_model.py contains the code to pass difficulty metrics and normalized traversal times through a neural net.
process_data.py contains code to read in data from files and convert it to a PyTorch dataset.

Running in Miniconda environment with Python 3.7, NumPy and PyTorch.

Storing difficulty files in a folder called "diff_files" and path files in a folder called "path_files" outside the metrics_to_difficulties directory.

Currently splitting dataset and giving 250 results to train and the other 50 to test.
